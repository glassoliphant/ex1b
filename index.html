					<h2>Goals</h2>
					  <p>My goals for this class are to get a sense of how the man behind the curtain operates. If I like coding, it could give me a way to earn a living that will free me up with regard to the art I make, both in terms of being able to afford the tools and supplies I want to use, and in terms of taking the pressure of sales off the muse.
					  </p>
					  <p>I don't know if I want to be a front-end, back-end, or iOS developer, a JavaScript wiz, or... 
					  </p>
					  <p>I've been working out of a home studio for the last couple years. This is amazing in that I can work on my art at any time, however I sometimes miss the office environment. A job in tech would expose me to new people and give me the opportunity to build new friendships.

					<h2>Concerns</h2>
						<p>I have pursued a degree in biology, physics, accounting, and economics (which was my eventual degree). The only aspects of learning I've ever struggled with are rote memorization, and feeling outside my comfort zone. The vocabulary may be a point of struggle, and will require active practice. The structure of this class will force me to get outside my zone just by 
						</p>
						<p>
						I have several concerns about this path, but they basically boil down to sticking with it. I got my degree, and promptly realized that while I loved the knowledge I didn't really know what I wanted to do with it. My husband had been encouraging me to pursue art almost since I met him, and with my certificate of adulthood in hand I was able to give myself permission to do that.
						</p>
						<p>My father and I converted my garage into a working studio, and doing the construction was some of the most fun I've had as an adult. So I designed and built a bike shed using timber-frame joinery as a practice project for building a small bathhouse. Most of my creative energy has redirected to this sort of project in the last year. To be fair to myself I haven't left glass behind. I'm still excited by projects in the pipeline, I'm just sidetracked from it. 
						</p>
						<p>The point being, I worry that I'll spend a bunch of money on pursuing this knowledge and then find myself ready to move on to the next thing. My mother has always said "education is never a bad thing," so I think it's worth the risk to at least try code on for size.

				  <h2>Every card has a title</h2>
					  <p>This card has a
					    <b>paragraph</b> of
					    <span class="redText">text</span> with a
					    <a href="http//www.google.com">link</a> . It also has a
					    <i>second</i> <span class="underline">sentence</span> of <span class="line-through">text</span> with a <a href="http//www.portlandcodeschool.com">link</a>.
					  </p>
					  <p><span class="greenText">This set of cards </span>serves as both practice and reference. I will keep this pen as a reminder of where I started from.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
				  <h2>Every card has a width</h2>
					  <p>
					    <b>but</b> we
					    <i>never</i> use pixels "px" to determine the size of a card.
					    <p>We use measurements that
					      <i>flex</i> , like percents (%), or relate to the size of the content, like
					      <i>root "em"</i> units (rem), which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.
				    </p>

				  <h2>This card has lists</h2>
					  <p>Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
					    <ul>
					      <li><a href="http//www.claireoliphant.com">go here</a></li>
					      <li><a href="http//pdxos.com">go here</a></li>
					      <li><a href="http//refreshpdx.com">go someplace else</a></li>
					    </ul>
					  </p>
					  <p>or as a way to display sets of things:</p>
					  <p>my favorite colors:</p>
						  <ul>
						    <li><span class="redText">red</span></li>
						    <li><span class="blueText">blue</span></li>
						    <li><span class="greenText">green</span></li>
						  </ul>
					  </p>
					  <p>You will use lists alot.</p>

				  <h2>Glossary</h2>
				  <p>This card collects terms and their definitions into a Description List Element (dl) for later reference</p>

				      <dt><b>element</b></dt>
				      	<dd>An <i>opening tag</i>, some <i>content</i>, and a <i>closing tag</i>. SOme elements don't have closing tags, and some elements are <i>self closing</i>.
