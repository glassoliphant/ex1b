					<h2>Goals</h2>
					  <p>My goals for this class are to get a sense of how the man behind the curtain operates. If I like coding, it could give me a way to earn a living that will free me up with regard to the art I make, both in terms of being able to afford the tools and supplies I want to use, and in terms of taking the pressure of sales off the muse.
					  </p>
					  <p>I don't know if I want to be a front-end, back-end, or iOS developer, a JavaScript wiz, or... 
					  </p>
					  <p>I've been working out of a home studio for the last couple years. This is amazing in that I can work on my art at any time, however I sometimes miss the office environment. A job in tech would expose me to new people and give me the opportunity to build new friendships.
					  </p>
					  <p>Finally, I am on the board of directors for Portland Open Studios or <a href="http://www.portlandopenstudios.com/">PDXOS</a>. Our budget is miniscule, so if I could take on some of the website work, it would free up some money for other parts of the program. I like the idea of having the capacity to help non-profits improve their access to good web services, while learning more about the job.</p>

					<h2>Concerns</h2>
						<p>I have pursued a degree in biology, physics, accounting, and economics (which was my eventual degree). The only aspects of learning I've ever struggled with are rote memorization, and feeling outside my comfort zone. The vocabulary may be a point of struggle, and will require active practice. The structure of this class will force me to get outside my comfort zone just by arriving at class, and using the slackroom (or now, GitHub) to let everyone see what's confusing me.
						</p>
						<p>
						I have several concerns about this path, but they basically boil down to sticking with it. I got my degree, and promptly realized that while I loved the knowledge I didn't really know what I wanted to do with it. My husband had been encouraging me to pursue art almost since I met him, and with my certificate of adulthood in hand I was able to give myself permission to do that.
						</p>
						<p>My father and I converted my garage into a working studio, and doing the construction was some of the most fun I've had as an adult. So I designed and built a bike shed using timber-frame joinery as a practice project for building a small bathhouse. Most of my creative energy has redirected to this sort of project in the last year. (To be fair to myself I haven't left glass behind. I'm still excited by projects in the pipeline, I'm just sidetracked from it.) 
						</p>
						<p>The point being, I worry that I'll spend a bunch of money on pursuing this knowledge and then find myself ready to move on to the next thing. My mother has always said "education is never a bad thing," and for the most part I agree. I can afford this class, so I think it's worth the risk to at least try code on for size.

				  <h2>Every card has a title</h2>
					  <p>This card has a
					    <b>paragraph</b> of
					    <span class="redText">text</span> with a
					    <a href="http//www.google.com">link</a> . It also has a
					    <i>second</i> <span class="underline">sentence</span> of <span class="line-through">text</span> with a <a href="http//www.portlandcodeschool.com">link</a>.
					  </p>
					  <p><span class="greenText">This set of cards </span>serves as both practice and reference. I will keep this pen as a reminder of where I started from.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
				  <h2>Every card has a width</h2>
					  <p>
					    <b>but</b> we
					    <i>never</i> use pixels "px" to determine the size of a card.
					    <p>We use measurements that
					      <i>flex</i> , like percents (%), or relate to the size of the content, like
					      <i>root "em"</i> units (rem), which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.
				    </p>

				</article>

				  <h2>This card has lists</h2>
					  <p>Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
					    <ul>
					      <li><a href="http//www.claireoliphant.com">go here</a></li>
					      <li><a href="http//pdxos.com">go here</a></li>
					      <li><a href="http//refreshpdx.com">go someplace else</a></li>
					    </ul>
					  </p>
					  <p>or as a way to display sets of things:</p>
					  <p>my favorite colors:</p>
						  <ul>
						    <li><span class="redText">red</span></li>
						    <li><span class="blueText">blue</span></li>
						    <li><span class="greenText">green</span></li>
						  </ul>
					  </p>
					  <p>You will use lists alot.</p>

					<h2>Notes 7/14/2015</h2>
					<p>Until now we've been working without version controll. The process has used a file system, a directory, and a working directory. Version controll adds some complexity, but also offers a layer of protection from losing data by adding a <b>staging area</b>, and a <b>repository</b>. The staging area is where you're files are added into a holding area using the git add command. When you're satisfied with additions and edits to your files you can use the <b>git commit -m""</b> command to add them to the repository. Each commit creates another repository layered on previous ones like strata of a canyon wall. Allows you to see "back in time" to a previous version of the project. Each commit has a unique number many characters long, most of the time only the first 8 digits or so are used to id.
					</p>
					<p>The <b>-m""</b> is a very important part of the git commit command. The commit cannot tell you anything about why you made a change, which may be important in figuring out which commit you want to use. The message portion of the command records the reason you made changes. The code itself should be clear and consise, self explanatory as to function, but the message lets you specify purpose.
					</p>
					<p><b>Cloning</b> a repository from the origin or Git (using git pull) doesn't require that you create a repository and adding a remote. Using git push to send a repository from local to Git does.
					</p>
					<p><b>Never</b> put a repository inside another repository! it makes git confused, and you wouldn't like git when it's confused. This most often happens because you lost track of where you were in the command line structure. This is why using <b>pwd</b> or looking at the command line itself is useful. The command line before the cursor gives you the drive name, and the file or folder you're in, eg Claires-MacBook-Air:ex1b ; pwd gives you the relative address of the file or folder you're in, eg: Users/Claire/Documents/pcs/ex1b 
					</p>
					<p><b>Always know where you're at!
					</b></p>
					<p><b>Never</b> go into .git ! Bad things will happen. If someone tries to show you something by going into your .git file, take your computer away from them and send them to the corner.
					</p>
					<p>If you see a <b>:</b> in the lower corner of your terminal where the cursor would be it means you're in a file. This may be a help screen or something git requires you to take care of (as in the case of forgetting to include a -m"" ). When you're finished use esc shift zz to exit.
					</p>
					<p>Using the <b>git status</b> command can be helpful when you're confused about what you need to do next. On my system, files in red need to be added to the staging area, in green are ready to be pushed to github. Git also tells you in text if there are changes not staged or ready for commit.
					</p>
					<p>Once you've used git push with the url and you're still logged in, you can use git push without the url to continue adding repositories to git.
